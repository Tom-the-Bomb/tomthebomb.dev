  Taipei, Taiwan's largest city and national capital, is a vibrant fusion of tradition and modernity.
  Sleek skyscrapers rise beside historic temples, while bustling night markets glow with neon light. Nestled within lush green hills,
  Taipei's nature offers breathtaking vantage points such as Elephant Mountain to view the skyline.
